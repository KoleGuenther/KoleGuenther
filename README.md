## Hey, I'm Kole ðŸ‘‹

I do stuff with data. Sometimes its on purpose, sometimes it works out. I practice stand-up in my commit messages.

### Experience:
- Python: wrangling with my code to make it behave... occasionally. Errors are responsible for 50% of my google searches.
- SQL: ask databases NICELY to give me what i want, only get it some of the time.
- Data Visualization: Making it look like the data is understandable
- Machine Learning: Like making brownies, a little bit of code, a lot of confidence, and a dash of prayer
- Excel: Practicing my wizardry in spreadsheets. Once went to BPA (Business Proffesionals of America) Nationals in California, with 1st place in Florida. 
- APIs: Requesting data from servers and showing the json data whos boss

### Currently Learning:
- Spark: because it seemed better than hadoop
- AWS: so i can move my bad ideas to the cloud AND scale them
- Analystical Analysis: analyzing my analysis to see if its analytically sound (still working on it)
- Those lil green jumpy guys (frogs): unrelated but definitely cute and important to happiness
