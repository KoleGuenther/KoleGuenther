## Hey, I'm Kole 👋

Data Science senior building applied ML systems on real-world data, from flood prediction to esports analytics.

I spend most of my time in Python and SQL, cleaning up messy data. I like structured data, reproducible pipelines, and figuring out why a model is suspiciously performing *too* well.

### Top Skills
- Python (pandas & scikit-learn)
- SQL
- Databricks & VSCode
- Excel/Sheets
- Tableau (& most Visualization Software)
- GitHub

### Currently Working on:
Alzheimer's Disease Risk Modeling (ADNI dataset)
Working with ~4,600 patient records and 200+ clinical features to build and validate predictive models. Recently completed a data quality report that looked at missingness analysis, leakage prevention, class imbalance handling, and feature engineering.

### Currently Learning more about:
- Reproducible ML Workflows (Using MLflow tracking)
- Spark SQL (through Databricks)
- Feature Engineering
